You should explain each step in any derivation so that both you and the grader can understand what you are doing.

Doing that pattern matching takes some experience, but it's often help to try and strip a problem of its extraneous detail and focus on what the core elements are. Then, if you can't see the path forward, try to find a problem that we (or the textbooks) have solved that has the same core elements. \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Submitting problem sets\n\nWe will be submitting the problem sets through [Gradescope]({{< var course.gradescope >}}).
